## Task 9

The sysadmin is tasked with installing the required packages for SElinux on `stapp01` server and also permanently disabling it for now.
Do not reboot the server or anything, while also ignoring the SElinux command line status.

First we use `yum update` and the `yum install selinux*` to install all SElinux packages.

With this, we can edit the `/etc/selinux/config` file and set `SELINUX=disabled` to permanently disable it, even after the reboot.

Editing the file:

Checking SElinux state with `sestatus`:
